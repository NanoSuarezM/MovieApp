# Movie app
						
Movie app shows the latest released movies in the world. In this example I play with the Rest API from themoviedb.org
						
# Architecture
						
I used MVVM for the architecture. It Separates presentation logic and business logic from the view improving the testability of the code.
For the binding between the view and view model I used closures for simplicity. The best approach would be use maybe FRP like RxSwift.

# API Key needed
If you download the code, be aware that an api key is needed. You need to get an api key from the website. If not the code will not compile.
