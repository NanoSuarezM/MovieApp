# Movie app
						
Movie app shows the latest released movies in the world. In this example I play with the Rest API from themoviedb.org
						
# Architecture
						
I used MVVM for the architecture. It Separates presentation logic and business logic from the view improving the testability of the code.
For the binding between the view and view model I used closures for simplicity. The best approach would be use maybe FRP like RxSwift.
